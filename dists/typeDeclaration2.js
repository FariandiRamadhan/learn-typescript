// Intersection Types (I used it when I can't extends from interface)
// We can combine two interface to make type or use it
// Type assert (I used it when I know the datatype, but TS don't)
// e.g. when we call something from a javascript file Typescript can't guess its datatype
export const identity = {
    name: "baz",
    address: "foo"
};
